My part was the loginscreen wich I programmed with pyqt6. It's very simple just a little window with a field for the username and another for the password. 
It also prints out an error window if you dont fill in the fields. There is also a "ok" and a "abbrechen" button.
I did not have any problems with qt. The only problem i encountered was the installation of qt6 it on my main computer.

My part was the login screen which I programmed with pyqt6. It's very simple, little window with a field for the username and another for the password. 
It also pops out an error window if you don't fill in the fields. There is also a "ok" and a "abbrechen" button.
I didn't have any problems with qt. The only problem I encountered was the installation of qt6 on my main computer.

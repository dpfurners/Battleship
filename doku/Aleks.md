Working on the client and server connection was quite fun, because in the last project, my task was also to make a client server connection, but there were many problems
for example sending the postition of one client to the other client. It had many problems, but it worked.
This time I wanted to make it more structured than last time and I think I did an okay job. 
Now we have an server client connection, that uses the database made by dominik and the login screen made by emanuel. 
PS: Daniel is the best scrum master you can imagine.

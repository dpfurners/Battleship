### 2. Dominik


#### My tasks:
    In the first week I had to deal with the database. My assignment was to set up the basic database, which consists of three coloumns:
    Username, Password, and the number of wins
    
    Additionally, I had to code functions which are used to write data into the database and query them.

#### The process:
    It wasn't that much of a challenge, so luckily I was able to handle my tasks very quickly. I watched a few videos and checked a few websites to learn
    how SQL worked again. After a short time I discovered SQLAlchemy. This tool helped me a lot because it translates python code into SQL code.
    I created a function for a login and a signin too.
    
    Overall it went really well, I finished my task in about 3 hours.

### 3. Emanuel

    My part was the login screen which I programmed with pyqt6. It's very simple, little window with a field for the username and another for the password. 
    It also pops out an error window if you don't fill in the fields. There is also a "ok" and a "abbrechen" button.
    I didn't have any problems with qt. The only problem I encountered was the installation of qt6 on my main computer.

### 4. Aleks
    
    Working on the client and server connection was quite fun, because in the last project, my task was also to make a client server connection, but there were many problems
    for example sending the postition of one client to the other client. It had many problems, but it worked.
    This time I wanted to make it more structured than last time and I think I did an okay job. 
    Now we have an server client connection, that uses the database made by dominik and the login screen made by emanuel.

My tasks:
In the first week I had to deal with the database. My assignment was to set up the basic database, which consists of three coloumns:
Username, Password, and the number of wins

Additionally, I had to code functions which are used to write data into the database and query them.


The process:
It wasn't that much of a challenge, so luckily I was able to handle my tasks very quickly. I watched a few videos and checked a few websites to learn
how SQL worked again. After a short time I discovered SQLAlchemy. This tool helped me a lot because it translates python code into SQL code.
I created a function for a login and a signin too.

Overall it went really well, I finished my task in about 3 hours.

## Documentation Sprint 1

### 1. Daniel

#### What did i do?
#### How did it go?

### 2. Dominik

#### What did i do?
#### In this week I remade the setup of the database and coded everything into a class as Daniel told me. (Still using pyalchemy)
#### I also fixed the functions which are used to write the data into the database and query them.
#### I also installed XAMPP Control Panel to make the database global and linked the code to it.
#### Adding a user, checking if the user exists and adding a win to a user works perfectly.

#### How did it go?
#### It wasnâ€™t that hard to manage the task. I already knew how to code with pyalchemy because of last week. The only problem was I started to code on
#### Sunday but Daniel told us to be finished until Saturday night. In the future I definitely try to be on time.
#### Overall, it went really well, I finished my task again in about 3 hours.


### 3. Emanuel

#### What did i do?
#### I programmed the game window, which is consists of 2 10 x 10 fields of buttons for the ships. 
#### There is also a section for statistics which haven't been defined jet.

#### How did it go?
#### It went pretty well but the main problem with qt is, that if you change something about the window it doesn't just change what you wantet to change.
#### It sometimes also changes things that should have stayed the same. 
#### It takes a lot of time to get everything to look like you want it to look.

### 4. Aleks

#### What did i do?
#### I did the lobby matchmaking system, which I included in my server code, where clients
#### can choose which player they want to play against (enter the name) and then start the
#### game (code for starting the game is not finished).

#### How did it go?
#### It went pretty well, but at first I had to think how the two clients could choose the 
#### other client they want to play against and how to put them then in the same lobby, but 
#### now it should work. Our codes are not properly implemented, so that the main game is not
#### running as it should. We have to work on our time management and communication.

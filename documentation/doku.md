### 4. Aleks

#### What did i do?
#### I did the lobby matchmaking system, which I included in my server code, where clients
#### can choose which player they want to play against (enter the name) and then start the
#### game (code for starting the game is not finished).

#### How did it go?
#### It went pretty well, but at first I had to think how the two clients could choose the 
#### other client they want to play against and how to put them then in the same lobby, but 
#### now it should work. Our codes are not properly implemented, so that the main game is not
#### running as it should. We have to work on our time management and communication.

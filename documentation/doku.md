## Documentation Sprint 2

### 1. Daniel

#### What did i do?
    Coordinting the team, helping with python language
#### How did it go?
    Basically, this week was the most efficient week, 
    all the errors that occured last week are solved now.
    But without error there would be no programming, 
    so there are new errors that we have to solve for next week.
    The GUI has problems with storing the field of the players,...

### 2. Dominik

#### What did i do?
    This week I coded two new functions: One of them checks if a ship can be placed in the chosen position. 
    The other function changes the state of the array that stands for the player field, so it actually places the ships.
    I also updtated old stuff like the database (e.g. created the database completely as a class)
#### How did it go?
    I didn't take me that long this time to complete my tasks. I almost had no problems and I was able to handle my tasks
    in about an hour.
    

### 3. Emanuel

#### What did i do?
    I codet the game window with a handler in the background who lets you move between the windows. 
    There are still some problems with the placements of the ships.
#### How did it go?
    It pretty well. I got some help from daniel with the handler. 
    Appart from the part with the ship placement i had no problems.

### 4. Aleks

#### What did i do?
    This week i made the ship models, the server logic, and i worked 
    on the lobby system, because there were still problems with it.
#### How did it go?
    It went ok, I spent more than the given 1 1/2 hours per week, because 
    it was quite difficult. Luckily Daniel was able to help me with errors 
    where i couldn't find a solution. Now the lobby matchmaking and placing
    ships on the field work, but I still have to fix certain things.
